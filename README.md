## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Scaler follows the **Clean Architecture** paradigm, which divides the project into distinct layers to promote separation of concerns and enhance scalability.

### Layer Breakdown

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - **Widgets & UI Components:** Responsible for rendering the user interface.
   - **State Management:** Utilizes Provider for managing app state.

2. **Domain Layer**
   - **Entities:** Core business objects of the application.
   - **Use Cases:** Encapsulate the business logic and rules.

3. **Data Layer**
   - **Repositories:** Abstract data sources and provide data to the domain layer.
   - **Data Sources:** Handle data retrieval from APIs, databases, or other sources.

*This separation ensures that each layer has a clear responsibility, making the app easier to maintain and extend.*
